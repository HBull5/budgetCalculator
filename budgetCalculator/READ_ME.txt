A calculator that calculates disposable Income 
given hourly wage, rent, hours worked per week, 
and up to 10 deductions Result is displayed in 
an alert window after entering an appropriate 
value in each field and clicking Calculate!

This was my first ever project I designed entirely 
on my own its a little rough but functional might 
recieve updates in the future. Built with HTML, javascript,
and CSS.

***Currently all fields must have an entry, soon
to change along with validation! and entries that 
aren't lost upon clicking on an already utilized 
box.***
